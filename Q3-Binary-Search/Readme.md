# Q3-Aggressive-Cows

Imagine you have some cows that are very aggressive, meaning they don't like being too close to each other. You also have a few stalls where you need to place them.

Now, the question is: How can we place these cows in the stalls so that the minimum distance between any two cows is as large as possible?

To solve this, we first sort the stalls and then use a smart way (binary search) to figure out the largest possible minimum distance between the cows.

 The problem is all about finding the right way to space out the cows so they stay as far apart as possible while still fitting into the stalls.
