This solution reverses the first K elements of a queue while keeping the order of the remaining elements unchanged. It does so by:

Dequeuing the first K elements and pushing them onto a stack.
Popping the elements from the stack (which reverses their order) and enqueuing them back into the queue.
Rotating the remaining elements in the queue to preserve their original order.
